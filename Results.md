### **Increasing compression while retaining highlights**
![bird example](./imgs/birds.eps)

This figure shows the simplification of three bird images by DMD (a1–c1) and SSDMD (a2–c2). Compared to DMD, SSDMD preserves the birds’ eyes while simplifying the background more, which
allows it to achieve higher compression ratios while keeping perceptually salient features.
